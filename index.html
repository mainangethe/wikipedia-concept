            The Bengal tiger <a href="#">(Panthera tigris tigris)</a> is a tiger population 
            native to the Indian subcontinent.<sup>[3]</sup> It is listed as Endangered 
            on the IUCN Red List since 2008, and was estimated at comprising 
            fewer than 2,500 individuals by 2011. 
            <br> <br>
            It is threatened by poaching, loss, and fragmentation of habitat. 
            None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within its range is 
            considered large enough to support an effective population of more 
            than 250 adult individuals.<sup>[1]</sup> India's tiger population was 
            estimated at 1,706–1,909 individuals in 2010.<sup>[4]</sup>
            <br> <br>
            By 2014, the population had reputedly increased to an estimated 
            2,226 individuals.<sup>[5]</sup> Around 440 tigers are estimated in Bangladesh, 
            163–253 tigers in Nepal and 103 tigers in Bhutan.<sup>[6][7][8][9]</sup>

            Ferdinand Porsche founded the company called 
            "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH" in 1931,[3] with main offices at 
            Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart.[4] Initially, the 
            company offered motor vehicle development work and consulting,[3] 
            but did not build any cars under its own name. One of the first 
            assignments the new company received was from the German government 
            to design a car for the people, that is a "Volkswagen".[3] 
            This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful 
            car designs of all time.[5] The Porsche 64 was developed in 1939 
            using many components from the Beetle.[3]
        
            <br> <br>

            During World War II,[6] Volkswagen production turned to the military 
            version of the Volkswagen Beetle, the Kübelwagen,[6] 52,000 produced, 
            and Schwimmwagen,[6] 15,584 produced.[7] Porsche produced several 
            designs for heavy tanks during the war, losing out to Henschel & Son 
            in both contracts that ultimately led to the Tiger I and the Tiger II. 
            However, not all this work was wasted, as the chassis Porsche designed 
            for the Tiger I was used as the base for the Elefant tank destroyer. 
            Porsche also developed the Maus super-heavy tank in the closing stages 
            of the war, producing two prototypes.[8]

            Nairobi (/naɪˈroʊbi/) is the capital and the largest city of Kenya. 
            The name comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates 
            to "cool water", a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through 
            the city. The city proper had a population of 3,138,369 in the 2009 
            census, while the metropolitan area has a population of 6,547,547. 
            The city is popularly referred to as the Green City in the Sun.[4]
            
            <br><br>
            Nairobi was founded in 1899 by the colonial authorities in British 
            East Africa, as a rail depot on the Uganda Railway.[5] The town 
            quickly grew to replace Mombasa as the capital of Kenya in 1907[6]. 
            After independence in 1963, Nairobi became the capital of the 
            Republic of Kenya.[7] During Kenya's colonial period, the city 
            became a centre for the colony's coffee, tea and sisal industry.[8] 
            The city lies on the River Athi in the southern part of the country, 
            and has an elevation of 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level.[9]

            <br><br>
            
            With a population of 3.36 million in 2011, Nairobi is the 
            second-largest city by population in the African Great Lakes region 
            after Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.[1][10] According to the 2009 census, 
            in the administrative area of Nairobi, 3,138,295 inhabitants lived 
            within 696 km2 (269 sq mi).[11] Nairobi is the 10th-largest city in 
            Africa, including the population of its suburbs.

            <br><br>

            Home to thousands of Kenyan businesses and over 100 major 
            international companies and organizations, including the 
            United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the 
            United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON), Nairobi is an established 
            hub for business and culture. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) 
            is one of the largest in Africa and the second-oldest exchange on 
            the continent. It is Africa's fourth-largest exchange in terms of 
            trading volume, capable of making 10 million trades a day.[12]
